Let me know if this works for you!\"\n\n---\n\n**User Query**: \"Can I make this stir fry in an oven instead?\"\n\n**Response**:\n\"Absolutely!

Use reasoning to identify key elements, such as word choice or sentiment indicators, before deciding on the emotional grade.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Analyze the content of the user's message:\n   - Identify keywords or phrases that indicate emotion or sentiment.\n   - Note any contextual clues that might affect the emotional tone.\n2. Write out a step-by-step reasoning about the emotional tone:\n   - Clearly state the evidence from the message.\n   - Explain why each piece of evidence contributes to the conclusion.\n   - Ensure that the reasoning is thorough to verify the correctness of the conclusion.\n3. Consider the overall context and word choice to assess the sentiment.\n4. Categorize the emotional tone of the message as one of the following grades: Negative, Neutral, or Positive.\n\n# Output Format\n\nRespond with the step-by-step reasoning followed by the final emotional tone grade. The format should be:\n\n- Reasoning: [detailed reasoning here]\n- Result: \"Negative,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Positive\"\n\n# Examples\n\n**Input:** \"I am not happy with the service.\"\n**Output:**\n- Reasoning: The phrase \"not happy\" indicates dissatisfaction. There are no positive elements in the message, and the context clearly suggests a negative experience.\n- Result: Negative\n\n**Input:** \"The meal was okay, nothing special but not bad either.\"\n**Output:**\n- Reasoning: The word \"okay\" indicates a neutral feeling. Phrases like \"nothing special\" and \"not bad\" suggest neither strong positive nor negative sentiment.\n- Result: Neutral\n\n**Input:** \"I had a wonderful time at the event!\"\n**Output:**\n- Reasoning: The word \"wonderful\" is a strong positive indicator. The context suggests an enjoyable experience.\n- Result: Positive\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Input: Hey there! I’m here to help transform your leftovers into something delicious and creative.
